1.  XML is also used as another widely used data exchange format.
please have a comparison between the two and pinpoint the differences
and similarities.  Would you still use JSON over XML or not?

 Yes. JSON is shorter and therefore smaller and faster to write. It's
 also slightly easier to parse in JavaScript.



2.  Is it possible to have two way communication without using
WebSocket protocol?  Please elaborate your answer.

 Yes. Various ways of polling seems to be the (poor) alternative. 
 


3.  What is REST architectural style?  Is our Twidder web application
based on REST architecture?  please elaborate your answer.

 Our web application is stateless since server behavious isn't
 dependant on client state. It's chacheable. The client has no storage
 responsibilities. Therefore I should say it's stateless. 



4.  What does web application deployment mean?  What pieces of
information do you think a web server needs to run a web application?

 It means deploying it in a web server so that it becomes reachable on
 the internet.



5.  Please mention and explain three real world functionalities which
require two way client-server communication to be implemented.  Is it
possible to implement them without two way communication? how?

 Instant messaging. Since the client has to be told by the server when
 it receives a message. Could be solved by polling aswell. 

 Social feeds can be filled as the server receives more content
 without the client having to reload the page.

 Games could use websockets to handle communication between server and
 clients.
