1.  What security risks can storing passwords in plain text cause?
How can this problem be addressed programmatically?

 They amplify the damage of SQL injections since it can yield plain
 text passwords rather than hashed passwords. Hashing and salting the
 passwords is recommended.



2.  As http requests and responses are text-based information, they
can be easily intercepted and read by a third-party on the Internet.
Please explain how this problem has been solved in real-world
scenarios.

 By end to end encryption. 



3.  How can we use Flask for implementing multi-page web applications?
Please explain how Flask templates can help us on the way?

 By returning different html segments on different routes, a multi
 page web application can be made. By substituting the routename
 through a template, templates can make sure you don't have to write
 similar html code multiple times.


4.  Please describe a Database Management System. How SQLite is
different from other DBMSs?

 A DBMS is the interface as to which the user or an application
 communicates with the database. SQLite stores it's database as a
 single file on the disk so it's only accessible on that machine.



5.  Do you think the Telnet client is a good tool for testing
server-side procedures?  What are its possible shortages

 Yes because you can send whatever http requests you'd like despite
 what the server expects. However managing tokens and whatnot was
 clunky because our server was expecting a the behaviour of web browser.
